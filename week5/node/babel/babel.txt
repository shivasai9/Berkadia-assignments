 what is babel???
 babel is a javascript compiler which converts newer versions of java script code to older versions.
 it takes the latest version of java script as input and converts it into es5 or older versions.
 
 why should we convert newer version into older versions???

  most of the browsers cannot support the latest version of java script so, at that time we need to convert that newer version
  into older version by using babel.

steps to be followed to use babel
1. npm init --yes
   run this command to create json file

2. npm i --save-dev babel-cli babel-preset-env
   run this command to install babel

3.create .babelrc file
   this file contains an object
    {
     "presets":["env"] 
     }
   env is a shortcut for telling babel that we are compiling from es15 or es16 or from latest versions.

4.in json file under scripts add 
   "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "babel newversion -d oldversion"
  }
 here newversion is a folder which contains latest versions of java script files.
 oldversion is target folder which consists of older versions of java script code.

5.npm start
   run this command then babel will convert the latest version of java script code into older versions and store it in oldversion folder.
