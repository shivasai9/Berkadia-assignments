   what is middleware function??
    a middleware function is a function that takes a request object and either returns a response to a client or passes 
    control to another middleware function.
    if we get a request on the server then that request goes to request processing pipeline and in this pipeline we have 
    one or more middleware functions each middleware function either terminates request or it passes control to another middleware function.
