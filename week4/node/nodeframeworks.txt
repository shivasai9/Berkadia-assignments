Frameworks other than express???

 1.Hapi
     it is used for larger enterprise applications.
     it uses declarative configuration.
     here we need to create an object for each route. by using this object we can describe what we want to do.
     for example we can call a function to process that request or we can do authentication or we can do data validation.
     similar to express hapi has its own ecosystem of middleware which is not compatable with the express and vice versa.
     The eco system for hapi is much smaller.
     hapi allows us to customize more things when it comes to request handler.
2.Koa
    koa is similar to express but it uses only async and await.
3.Loopback
    it is maintaining by ibm.
    it has a database library and a web interface which allows us to create a project with less code.
    loopback is for those people who don't like to code much.
    But loopback is difficult to learn
    it is compatable with express.
4.Mean
    Mean.js is a full-fledged JavaScript framework to build web applications using NoSQL database, MongoDB as well as Angular.js for the 
    front-end and Express.js/Node.js for the backend (server). It also leverages the Grunt tool to enable automated testing. Mean.js and Mean.io 
    are both considered a part of Mean stack. Mean stands for MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js and Node.js.
5.Sails
    Sails.js is one of the most popular real-time frameworks around for building Node.js applications. Sails.js offers a model-view controller (MVC) 
    pattern for implementing data-driven application programming interfaces (APIs). The framework has gained ground for building real-time chat applications, 
    dashboards and multiplayer games.Sails.js is built on top of Node.js and uses Express.js for handling HTTP requests.
