 What is DDOS attack???
  it stands for distributed denial of service attack.
  The main aim  of ddos attack is to slow down the popular websites.

 Denial of service attack?????
  DOS attack is an attack which is coming from only one server.
  But the network or server can easily able to handle the attack because there is only one source.
  simply the server can close the connection from where the attack is coming from.

 How attacker gets the other sources to get involved in DDOS attack????  
  The attacker will develop a malware program and distribute it to internet and he will put it on some websites or sends an email attachments containing the malware program.
  if anyone go to that infected websites or opens the infected email attachments then the malware will be installed in their computer without the permission of owner.
  The group of all these infected computers are  called as "BOTNET".
  There is no end for botnet.
  The attacker controls all the infected devices.
  i.e attacker is the master and all the infected devices are the slaves.
  These all infected devices can attack simultaneously to a certain server or network due to which the website using that server becomes very slow and unresponsive.
  This is what the DDOS attack mean.
