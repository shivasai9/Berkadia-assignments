  WHAT IS SOAP????
   it stands for simple object access protocol.
   it is a heavy weight choice for web serice access.
   it is a xml based message protocol.
   it invokes services by calling rpc(rempote procedural call) method.
   it does not return human readable return.
   data transfer is over http and also uses other protocols such as smtp,ftp etc.
   java script can call soap but it is difficult to implement.

  ADVANTAGES OF SOAP AVER REST ARE
   language, platform and transport independent.
   it has buildin error handling.
   automation when we use certain language proucts.

  WHAT IS REST????
   it stands for representative state transfer.
   it is an architectural style protocol.
   it uses xml or json to snd and receive data.
   it simply calls services via url path.
   it returns the result which is readable and it is a plain xml or json.
   data transfer is over http only.
   it is easy to call from java script.
   
  ADVANTAGES OF REST OVER SOAP???
   performance is much better than soap.
   non expensive tools are required to interact with web services.
   we can learn it easily.
   it is efficient because it uses smaller message formats.
   it is fast compared to soap.

we need to select soap or rest based on the 
  1.programming language we use
  2.environment which we use it.
  3.depends on the requirements of the application.
