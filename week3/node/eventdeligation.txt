what is event deligation?????
 event deligation is also called as event bubbling or event propagation.
 it is a strategy that we can use to optimise the performance of our web apps when responding to our events.

 example:
   when we pour soda into a glass a bubble will go from bottom to top.
   on web page bubbling means when there is an event on web page the execution of the events goes from the lowest element to the top.
   let child, parent and body have a click event 
   when we click on the child button,
     1st it executes the child click event then it would go to the parent click event and then it executes the body click event.
   Event bubbling means events are executed from bottom to top like a bubble in the soda.
