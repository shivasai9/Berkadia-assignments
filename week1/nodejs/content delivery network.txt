 Content delivery network??

   If more people are using the same webite at same time then that website server may become slow and unresponsive.
   If we want to avoid this problem we need to use this content delivery network(cdn).
   CDN distributes the data content of a website and put it into the servers which are close to the people by this we can 
    eliminate the above problem.
