1. what is v8 engine??
    It is a java script engine which converts java script into machine code. 
  why conversion???
   generally browser cannot understand the java script. it understands only the machine code so we need to convert java
script into browser understandable machine code
   V8 engine was developed by google written in c++ because nodejs itself written in c++ if we want to include v8 engine 
in nodejs it should also written in c++. it is also called as java script virtual machine. it is similar to jvm(java virtual machine).
