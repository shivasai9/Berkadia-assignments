$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

4.docker start container_id/name
     it will start the conatiner.

5.docker stop container_id/name
     it will stop the container.

6.docker pause container_id/name
     it will pause the container.

7.docker unpause container_id/name
     it will unpause the container.

8.docker top container_id/name
     it will show the top processes of the container.

9.docker stats container_id/name
     it will show the status of the running container like memory usage, cpu performance etc.

10.docker attach container_id/name
     use docker attach to attach your terminal's standard input, output, and error (or any combination of the three)
     to a running container using the container's id or name.

11.docker kill container_id/name
     it is used to kill one or more containers.

12.docker rm container_id/name
     it is used to delete the one or more containers.
