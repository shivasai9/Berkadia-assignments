  what is a module???
    A module is a buildin block where we can define our functionsand variables.
    Every function in a node application is considered as a module.
    Every node application will have one module compulsary called main module.
    A module has 7 properties
     1.id
     2.exports
     3.parent
     4.file name
     6.loaded
     7.children
     8.paths
  There are two types of modules are present they are
  1.local modules.
  2.global modules.
 
  1.local modules:
        If we use these modules in our application then if we make any changes in our application then we need to run it again to get the updated output.
      installation:
            npm install module_name
  2.Global modules:
        If we use these global modules in our application then if we make any changes in our application then it will automatically runs and output is updated.
      installation:
            npm install -g module_name
     Examples: nodemon, live-server etc.
